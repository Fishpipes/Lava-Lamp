# Lava-Lamp
This is the code for my Lava Lamp, it uses 72 programable LEDs on a high density 144/m strip.

I have built a table top lamp using an old bathroom wall light shade and a strip of 72 programable LEDS. The LEDs are WS2812b, laid out on a high density strip of 144/m.

I choose this configuration for the LEDs because I wanted aas many LEDs in as small a space as I could get.
